    "# Establishing a database connection\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Engine\n",
    "The start of any SQLAlchemy application is an object called the Engine. The engine is typically a global object created just once for a particular database server, and is configured using a URL string which will describe how it should connect to the database host or backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Engine is created by using create_engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "### The URL string\n",
    "The main argument to create_engine() is a URL string. This string indicates to the Engine three important facts:\n",
    "1. What kind of database are we communicating with? In our example we're using 'mssql' for Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What DBAPI are we using? The Python DBAPI is a third party driver that SQLAlchemy uses to interact with a particular database. In this case, we’re using the name pyodbc, which is an open source Python module for accessing ODBC databases. (ODBC is a standard API for accessing databases.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do we locate the database? In our case we need to specify the server and database name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting a connection\n",
    "The sole purpose of the Engine object from a user-facing perspective is to provide a unit of connectivity to the database called the Connection. When working with the Core directly, the Connection object is how all interaction with the database is done. As the Connection represents an open resource against the database, we want to always limit the scope of our use of this object to a specific context, and the best way to do that is by using Python context manager form, also known as the with statement."

Bad implementations of database interfaces, like the one in the example above, leaves **ALL** your data open for an attack. **ANY** database operation that can be made in a tool like Mangagement Studio can also be made through a web form, or similar user input, using SQL injection.\n",
